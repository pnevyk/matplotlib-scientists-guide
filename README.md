# Matplotlib scientist's guide

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a high-quality, powerful and widely used Python 2D plotting library. It is a
perfect choice to make your figures with. It has thorough documentation, helpful guides and plenty of question-answer
posts around the internet.

This guide is intended for people who want to utilize Matplotlib for their scientific work written in LaTeX, although
some information presented here is useful in general. This kind of information is not so common on the internet, and
when it exists, it is scattered in different blog posts or answers.

### Table of contents

* ["Object-oriented" Matplotlib](objects.md)
* [Setting figure sizes and resolution](sizes-and-resolution.md)
* [Styling](styling.md)
* [File format](format.md)
* [Tips and tricks](tips-and-tricks.md)

## Notes

This guide is not intended to be an exhaustive reference of how you do things in Matplotlib. Instead, this is made to be
a brief source for the most fundamental issues which everyone deals with during making figures for his publication.

It will continually grow with more information included, however, it will not turn into tutorial-like articles with long
texts explaining everything.

## Contribution

Contributions are, as always, very welcome. You can add a content, improve the content, or just mention what you think
should be present in this guide.
